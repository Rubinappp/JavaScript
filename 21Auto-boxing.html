  console.log('hello'.length)//.length is property of string 
  console.log('hello'.toUpperCase())//.toUpperCase is method of string 
  // But here hello  is  strings how can it have property and method? js has special feature called auto-boxing. js wrap that string into a object like special box  .
  // It works with number and string but auto boxing wont work with null and undefined
