<!-- We'll create a coin-flip game (create 1 HTML file for exercises 6f - 6j):

6f. Generate a random number with Math.random(). Save it in a variable
6g. Create an if-statement and check:
· If the number is less than 0.5, then display 'heads' in the console.
. Else display 'tails' in the console.
6h. Instead of displaying 'heads' or 'tails' in the console, save the result
in a variable called 'result'.
6i. Let's say we're trying to guess the result. Create a variable called
'guess' and save your guess ('heads' or 'tails').
· If your guess matches the result, display 'You win!' in the console
· If your guess does not match the result, display 'You lose!'
6j. (Challenge) Instead of using if-statements in the previous exercises,
try switching them into ternary operators (condition ? A : B). -->
