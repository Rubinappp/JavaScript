<!--
6a. Create a variable called 'hour' and save the current hour of the day
(use 24-hour format and save it as a number between 0 and 23).
. If hour is between 6 and 12, display 'Good morning!' in the console
. If hour is between 13 and 17, display 'Good afternoon!' in the console
. Otherwise, display 'Good night!' in the console

6b. Continuing from 6a, try changing the value in the 'hour' variable to
make it display different messages.

6c. Continuing from 6a, create a variable called 'name' and save your
name inside (as a string). Update the if-statement to display your
name in each message. For example: 'Good morning ${name}!'

6d. Imagine an amusement park that has a discount for children (6 year
and younger) or seniors (65 years and older).
· Create a variable 'age' and save a person's age inside.
. Create an if-statement that checks if the person qualifies for a
discount. If they do, display 'Discount' in the console. Otherwise,
display 'No discount' in the console.
Note: try to use the || operator in your solution.
· Try changing the 'age' variable to display different messages.

6e. Continuing from exercise 6d, let's say the discount is only available
if it is not a holiday. Create a variable: const isHoliday = true;
· Update the code so that in order to get a discount, people must
meet the age requirement and it is also not a holiday.
. Note: && has a higher priority than || so you may need to use
brackets () to control which code gets done first.
· Try changing the value of isHoliday to display different messages.
