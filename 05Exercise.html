<!-- 
5a. Create a <script> element. Inside the <script>, create a variable
called 'name', and save your name in this variable (as a string).

5b. Continuing from 5a, display the message 'My name is: ${name}' in the
console (insert the 'name' variable created in 5a into this message).

5c. At a restaurant, you order 1 coffee ($5), 2 bagels ($3 each), and 1 soup
($9). Calculate the cost and save it in a variable called 'cost'.

5d. Continuing from 5c, display 'Cost of food: $${cost}' in the console.

5e. Let's say the restaurant charges a 10% tax. Using the 'cost' variable
from 5c, calculate the tax (hint: multiply by 0.1), and save the result
in a variable.

5f. Continuing from 5e, display 'Tax (10%): $${tax}' in the console.

5g. Continuing from 5f, calculate the total (cost + tax), save it in a variable
called 'totalCost', and display the message 'Total cost: $${totalCost}'
in the console.
